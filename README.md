# Number-Guesser-Doubles

### This Project Utilizes:
##### - HTML
##### - CSS
##### - Vanilla JavaScript

### Learning Goals for this project:
To create a responsive and functional site that replicates the comp as closely as possible. In this project we focused on creating semantic HTML as well as dry CSS and JS. Our comp recreation meets all the standards of phases one through three as well as some aspects of phase four. Our JavaScript is refactored and uses arguments and parameters when possible. We also feel strong with our naming conventions as they are clear and descriptive. Overall we feel that this project really helped us practice how to write dry, understandable code as well as how to visually re-create a responsive comp.
